  <p class="project-paragraph "> Maze, a research/insight testing platform, was looking for ways to improve its current main workflows. Their main feature is the so-called "mission block" where researchers or designers can input their prototype link for their designated testers to go through. Currently, Maze has difficulties in improving the mission block workflow as well as supporting their researchers/designers to ask follow-up questions. Hence, looking for ways to support this goal has become the main goal. </p>
  <h3  class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Research Direction</h3>
  <p class="project-paragraph ">We discovered Maze's interface had many components that will create visual confusion. If we could decrease the amount of visual confusion, we can improve users'
    experience. Nevertheless, we decided to first understand our users' pain points and expectations when they conduct prototyping/usability tests to validate this workflow redesign is necessary.</p>
    <h3  class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Solution</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph">Maze's business goal aligns with users' expectations. Hence, my team utilized mind-mapping to brainstorm new solutions to improve the status quo. In the end, we came up with a "duplication feature" where the users can duplicate sample questions from Maze's templates to set up proper and meaningful mission blocks and follow-up question blocks. This cost-effective solution also offers our users more guidance when creating their own usability tests.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">This case study is from the UX/UI bootcamp, <em>Memorisely</em>. We collaborated with Maze, an online prototyping/insight collecting platform, to help improve their main services. Maze's main feature is the so-called "mission block" where researchers or designers will input their prototype link and design meaningful survey questions for their testers to provide insights. Currently, Maze reached out to Memorisely and wished the bootcamp students can shed new light on their current mission block workflow. How we could improve the current feature flow while also supporting researchers/designers to ask follow-up questions about their prototypes became the main goal.</p>

    <h2 class="project-section-title">Fresh Eye Audit and Observation</h2>

    <p class="project-paragraph">Before doing anything, it is important to observe the existing interface of Maze.
      To easily document the process, I use the structure of <b>[situation], [response], [problem to business or experience]</b> to ensure I'm aware of users and business needs. Doing these observations also allows me to understand whether Maze has any pressing problems that can become new opportunities for refreshment (Figure 1).</p>


      <figure>
        <img src="image/maze_obser.png" class="project-image" alt="observation">
        <figCaption>Figure 1: I went through Maze's current flow to conduct user flow observation. </figCaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img src="image/maze_old_interface.png" class="project-image" alt="current interface audit">
        <figCaption>Figure 2: Maze current interface is full of highlighted touchpoints calling for users' attention.
          These interactive components can further cause user confusion. We might have to find a way to prioritize which area needed attention first.</figCaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="project-paragraph">During the observation process, I noticed Maze has compacted much information in the editing screen after the users create their projects. The editing screen is divided into 3 columns with multiple highlights to attract the users to engage with them. If we closely observe the interface, we notice the users are faced with at least 7 highlighted touchpoints calling them for interactions. Each column has multiple either unlabeled or ambiguous interactive components (Figure 2). The relationship between the middle column and the right panel is even more unclear when the users are inputting content. For instance, when the users decide to import an image into the question block, the users have to go to the right column to select the images. However, when the users want to cancel their selection, the "cancel" button is surprisingly located on the top right corner away from the middle column (Figure 3). It took me several tries to discover how to undo my action. Overall, it is unclear that what the meaning of the right column is â€” is it a preview screen for the entire survey? or a file selection area? The ambiguity introduces more confusion to the users.
        </p>

          <figCaption>Figure 3: The connection between the content column and the preview column is hard to grasp. We need to redesign and find a way to strengthen the relationship between the two </figCaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="project-paragraph">I then went on creating the observation and assumption summary. I described the points I considered contributing to the general poor navigations and tasking of the main mission block workflow (using the structure mentioned in the previous paragraph):</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph note">When <em>[users first enter into the process of creating a project]</em>,<br>
          Users <em>[are thrown into Maze where it forces the users to click around to explore the tool. Instead of informing users where they are, Maze makes the users read through the crowded/ unclear buttons, descriptions and guidelines]</em>,<br>
          Which <em> [might increase cognitive load and annoy users' experience].</em></p>

          <p class="project-paragraph note">When <em>[users first enter into the process of creating a project]</em>,<br>
            Users <em> [are introduced with numerous controls or buttons that are unlabeled or have inaccurate representations]</em>,<br>
            Which <em>[might confuse the users on what the next step is when they are trying to test things out]</em>.</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph note">When <em>[users first enter into the process of creating a project]</em>,<br>
              Users <em>[are introduced to an inconsistent edit input panel and preview screen that have a vague relationship]</em>,<br>
              Which <em>[occasionally confuses the users on where to find the meaningful control and display]</em>.</p>

              <h2 class="project-section-title">Setting a Research Goal</h2>
              <p class="project-paragraph">After discussions with my teammates, we assumed the Maze's interface could be improved tremendously to help the designers or researchers using Maze have a smooth workflow. Naturally, we would want to validate whether or not this was how the users felt. However, sometimes the business goal doesn't necessarily align with the user's need. To ensure users' need is the same as Maze's, we then decided to set our research direction broader to collect as many responses as possible to understand how we can combine users' goals with Maze's vision. Hence, the research direction is broad:</p>

              <p class="project-paragraph note">To understand what users know about usability testing and what their expectations are specifically for remote testing
                &rarr; <b>so that we can embed their expectations into our interface and most importantly, our mission block flow.</b></p>

                <h2 class="project-section-title">Remote User Research</h2>
                <p class="project-paragraph">To confirm our observations and assumptions, each team member designed several versions
                  of the survey to receive a variety range of replies.</p>

                  <p class="project-paragraph note"> <a href="https://shadow-dawn-84c.notion.site/Maze-Personal-Survey-Questions-c46f5c85516a4fb18beae064cb80dfe2" class="paragraph-in-text">Check my survey questions</a><br>
                  &rarr; this survey was to generally understand what our users think about different forms of prototyping and testing</p>

                  <p class="project-paragraph note"><a href="https://shadow-dawn-84c.notion.site/Maze-Team-Survey-Questions-ed84bfd9ec3d4d7c97bf4fa53786d9b0" class="paragraph-in-text">
                    Check my team survey questions</a><br>&rarr; By embedding the functionality questions about Maze into the questions, we can indirectly receive feedback on users' mental models and thoughts about conducting a testing</p>
