    <h2  class="project-section-title first-paragraph first-title">Overview</h2>
    <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Problem Preview</h3>
    <p class="project-paragraph ">Paladin had been struggling to recruit new security professionals. People didn't know about Paladin's culture and opportunities. Furthermore, they tended to call or email Paladin for
      general inquiries and job opportunities instead of browsing the website. How we could help Paladin reestablish trust via their website (specifically the homepage and the career page) became the main scope of the problem.</p>
      <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Time</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph ">2 months</p>
      <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Design Constraints</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph ">The company wished to find out the possible root problems that caused low website engagement on the homepage and career page to help with the recruitment. Due to the time, budget and confidentiality, this project didn’t have the chance to include a direct user interview; however, to estimate the research direction and verify the assumptions, I took an informal holistic design mindset to investigate what state Paladin’s website was at and the opportunities we could possibly offer. To do so, I first examined the website analytics and job applicant profiles compiled by the marketing team to understand what and how the users might be having trouble. Informal competitor analysis and an estimated version of journey mapping were also conducted to explore how the old information architecture and content representation were disrupting web visitors’ trust towards Paladin.</p>
      <h3 class="project-paragraph in-para-overview-title">Outcomes</h3>
      <p class="project-paragraph">New information architecture diagrams were developed to structure the content order. Designing with the holistic design idea in mind, the new information architectures also have become the foundation for future content refreshes. The new website is also structured with clear sections, visual representations and buttons to signal relevant content for the web users — specifically for the job applicants. Although further usability testing and iteration are needed, because of the collective efforts, <b>the website had a 60% increase in sessions</b> after being live for the first 2 months (Figure 1).</p>
      <p class="project-paragraph">An <a href ="#accessibility" class="paragraph-in-text">informal design system document</a> and <a href ="#responsiveness" class="paragraph-in-text">mobile version of the website using Figma </a> were also developed to ensure functionality and consistency.</p>

      <h2 class="project-section-title">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="project-paragraph first-paragraph">Paladin Security is Canada's leading provider of security services. I worked as the only Visual & UX/UI Designer in the marketing team overseeing all the design work across Paladin and its group of companies. </p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">Helping Paladin to refresh their web homepage and career page was the most difficult UX/UI project that I have worked on. It was because we didn't have the time and budget to reach out to actual users to validate our design decisions. The only thing we could do was roll out our design quickly and collect insights in real-time.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">Nevertheless, this experience has taught me how to explore the project with a holistic design mindset; it invited me to consider how the website might mean differently to different stakeholders under different constraints. Because of this mindset, I was able to communicate my thought process clearly to my team by involving them in each step and looking at the problem from a different angle to discover new opportunities. Most importantly, this approach also had inspired my team to collaborate with one another to create more goal-oriented opportunities. The project also has taught me how to strategize approaches to verify my design assumptions — which is something valuable when the team has to work under constraints. </p>

      <h2 class="project-section-title">Problem Context</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="image/career_heat.png" class="project-image" alt="website analytics of the old website">
        <figCaption>Figure 2: A heat map and the scroll map of our home page and career page. We can see the main content is not actively going through in the scroll maps (blue). Most people seem to either not find the info useful or intriguing. The heat maps also showcase people not engaging with the copywriting or CTA. </figCaption>
      </figure>

      <p class="project-paragraph">Paladin had been struggling to recruit new security professionals. The HR team collaborating with the marketing team had strategized different social media campaigns to invite more engagements online; however, many job applicants still did not know much about Paladin's opportunities or services. There was a tendency of people to call the company office for information instead of finding the information on Paladin's website. This user behaviour had been putting much stress on the HR and the marketing team. Hence, because of the company’s need, the website refresh project’ specifically for the homepage and the career page, was initiated.
      </p>
      <p class="project-paragraph">Before proceeding, I looked into the website analytics to observe how our website users interact on these two pages. It was surprising to see how people seldom interact or read through our website. Figure 2 is a screenshot of the user engagement heat maps and user scroll maps. A huge section of the web pages was covered in blue/green in the scroll map which implies low interaction to either the content or its representation. This indication shed some light on the direction we had to prioritize — content improvement.</p>

      <h2 class="project-section-title">From User Research Challenges to Opportunities — “Whoah, No Direct User Interviews?!”</h2>

      <p class="project-paragraph">Before taking any action, I reached out to my team to check whether there was any generative research about our users or job applicants applying to Paladin. I was then given a document of applicant profile where it listed out three different groups of people that interact with Paladin's job opportunities and services. The main groups were: the new generation of law enforcement graduates, immigrants with law, military or security backgrounds and career transitioners. Although reaching out to these groups of people to conduct further interviews is more ideal, I wasn't able to perform any of the research due to budget, confidentiality and time.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">To best estimate and propose the next direction, I closely examined the applicant profiles and had meetings with the entire marketing team to
        further understand who these applicants were and any potential ways to pinpoint their major pain points.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="image/career_applicant.png" class="project-image" alt="job applicant profiles">
          <figCaption>Figure 3: A venn diagram of how the job applicants have in common. It was discovered that these three groups of people might need more introductions and resources before transitioning into the security industry.   And Paladin is here to help!</figCaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="project-paragraph">I discovered our main applicants had one major thing in common — most of them are new to either the industry or the country (Figure 3). This piece of information suggested that these job applicants possibly
          need more information than just having a usual job description. If I am able to tackle the common problem for these three groups, the impact of this refresh project would be more prominent.</p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">To verify my assumption, I quickly created a user journey map to estimate our applicants' emotions and feelings when browsing our website (Figure 4). The mapping outcome reinforced the low user engagement from the analytics in a way that many of the user expectations were unmet during the website visit. This mapping also helped the team to understand Paladin's content should be more organized and goal-oriented. It should help the viewers understand who Paladin is and how Paladin is able to assist them to advance in the security industry.</p>

            <figCaption>Figure 4: A screenshot of the estimated user journey map. The map shows a lot of places for content
              improvements. Perhaps the lack of this specific content had contributed to the applicants’ decision of calling Paladin.</figCaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="project-paragraph">To broaden our perspective, I also decided to conduct an informal competitor analysis. Our competitor, GardaWorld, was likely interacting with the same group of applicants and it would be valuable to study how they arrange and construct their content (Figure 5). On GardaWorld's homepage, they introduce their services, hiring opportunities, company values and office location clearly on their main page. Every content block is there for a reason and is associated with a clear topic. On their career page, they have clear information about what positions they offer as well as further details about their work culture, locations and values. Coming from a visual background, I also did a quick observation on the Paladin’s layouts. Inclusive/diverse photos, clean layouts, accurate descriptions and noticeable primary buttons are needed to improve the current company image.</p>

              <figCaption>Figure 5: A screenshot of Paladin’s top competitor — Garda World’s homepage and career page.
                Garda World has detailed information about who they are and what they offer to their clients as well as potential job applicants. This clarity has inspired us to provide more diverse content and design opportunities.</figCaption>
              </figure>

              <h2 class="project-section-title">New Information Architecture and Design Holistically to Go Beyond the Brief</h2>

              <p class="project-paragraph">One important aspect of a <a href ="https://medium.com/joint-futures/towards-a-holistic-design-approach-122dcf4d02c0" class="paragraph-in-text">holistic design mindset </a> is to collaborate horizontally; this idea means designers should involve as many stakeholders as possible in the process to learn about their expectations. That way, the team is able to work towards the same central goal. The reason why the idea of having horizontal collaborations is brought up in this project is we were changing Paladin's digital presence via content and other visual communication opportunities. It is crucial to understand the concerns and visions that the marketing team had at the time. Hence, to best align my vision with the team, I decided to visualize my thought process into several how-might-we questions and communicated them to the marketing team (Figure 6).</p>

              <figure>
                <img src="image/career_hmw.png" class="project-image" alt="the how-might-we questions that led the design process">
                <figCaption>Figure 6: some of the HMW questions I set out to communicate what the team should be focusing on for
                  the website refresh project. This way, the team can collectively work together to ideate new possibilities to scale up Paladin’s digital impact.</figCaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="project-paragraph">As my first step, I mapped out the old information architecture diagram to pinpoint places that could be improved on both the career page and the homepage. In figure 7, we can notice how the content on the homepage didn't follow a meaningful order. Although the career page had content that was relevant to what the users might be looking for, the order and the relevancy of the content still needed more work because it was outdated and didn't reflect what Paladin could promise to their applicants.</p>

                <p class="project-paragraph">To involve the marketing team, I articulated my estimated user journey map to invite them to re-observe the website user flow and content and ideate from their marketing point of view. What surprised me the most was that we, later on, discovered some services on different parts of the website were a part of Paladin's groups of companies’ responsibilities. This inconsistency might reflect why people tend to call or email the office since the web information isn't reliable. Most importantly, crucial content like company-paid training, Paladin’s commitments, Paladin’s core value — Paladin Difference or other existing blogs that would help the inexperienced applicants to advance in the security industry was unmentioned. These topics can help establish who Paladin is.
                </p>

                  <img src="image/career_inarc.png" class="project-image" alt="the old information architecture diagram of the homepage and career page">
                  <figCaption>Figure 7: This is a representation of how Paladin's websites look like before/after the refresh. There were not many actions users could take on the old website. The content was outdated as well — which might have created disconnection and confusion. By laying out the information architecture of the old website, my team was able to discover where to place effective content to improve user experiences and introduce Paladin as a company that cares for people's safety.</figCaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="project-paragraph">In return, the other marketing team members also introduced the SEO guidelines they usually follow when they craft out Paladin's digital presence. They also considered this website refresh project as a good chance to unify Paladin's digital voice and build a hub to amplify Paladin's influence. We drafted out the new information architecture diagram specifically for the homepage and the career page to fulfill the recruitment purpose (Figure 8) together while also brainstorming other initiatives that could make the website refresh more impactful (Figure 9).</p>

                  <figCaption>Figure 8: the new information architecture was crafted out collectively with different perspectives from different professions. It was important to include as many voices as possible in the new content structure since we had to ensure we had unified goals to make the outcome more impactful.</figCaption>

                  <img src="image/career_opp.png" class="project-image" alt="other opportunities the team came up with to scale up the impact">
                  <figCaption>Figure 9: Other possible ideas that could help our job applicants to understand Paladin and the Canadian
                    security industry. It is crucial to put the resources and company culture upfront to allow the visitors to understand Paladin's commitments in helping their employees strive in the industry.</figCaption>
                  </figure>

                  <p class="project-paragraph">Those initiatives went beyond the original brief — my team members went on to explore the content structure of other pages so as to ensure content consistency. For instance, on the "About Us" and "Locations" page, new content like "Why Paladin", "Paladin Cares", "Our Culture" and regional team information was created; future security knowledge articles and new media such as career/company blog or podcast were also centralized. These new content additions both fulfill the audience's need to understand Paladin while also reinforcing Paladin’s company commitment and values which can help build the trust back. In a sense, it was because of the holistic design mindset and the horizontal collaboration, the plan of refreshing Paladin’s digital impact could be scaled up.
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="project-section-title">Wireframes and Mockups to Effectively Represent Content</h2>
                  <p class="project-paragraph">After receiving content structure help, I did a UI audit on the Paladin website and also looked into the website analytics to understand what users might have trouble with. For instance, the service information on the original home page, the buttons weren't obvious enough to show they were interactive (Figure 10). It might confuse a few visitors since a few people might think the titles were clickable; the images on the side of the service description could be confusing to the visitors too since it made the layout clutter together (Figure 10).</p>
